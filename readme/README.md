# flap-anatomies

Diagram1 contains all the code for the original flap diagram.
Diagram2 is a close replica to it, besides some changes because of difference in flaps/directions.

Within Diagram1 there is the main entry file flapanatomy.htm, 
all supporting code is within Assets, the flaps are contained inside Components.

All of the code that handles user-interactions and maintaining the system is in flapsheet-embed.js
All of the styling is in flapsheet-embed.css
